v0.6
- Another exit and more endings
- Crouching and hiding mechanics
- Improved intro sequence (still a work in progress)
- Better Class D models, although they're still just placeholders
- Improved MTF AI. Now they head to the last location the player was spotted in, and 
start randomly searching for him. They'll also try to recontain SCP-106 when they
reach it's chamber.
- An injury/bloodloss system, so now it's possible (although hard) to survive being 
shot. Gunshot wounds make you bleed, and losing too much blood eventually kills you.
Injuries can be healed with first aid kits, but it takes some time (so you can't just 
start bandaging a wound while you're being shot at) and a regular first aid kit
won't heal you completely. The degree of the injuries depends on which part of your 
body got hit - headshots are still instakill.

- A console command for spawning items (spawnitem [the name of the item])
- An anomalous duck
- A ton of small bugfixes

- ...And a last minute addition, SCP-096. It's using a placeholder model made by
Mirocaine until we get a better one.

v0.5
- GATE B and multiple endings. So now it's possible to get out and BEAT THE GAME.
- Mobile Task Force groups whose job is to clear the facility of the escaped
SCPs and other potential hazards (they still need some tweaking and their AI may 
be a bit buggy at times)
- some new rooms (including the silo of the Omega Warhead)
- improved map generation algorithm:
	- it shouldn't generate maps that are impossible to get through anymore
	- no more of those black "fake walls"
- SCP-106 uses an A*-based pathfinding algorithm, so now it won't just float
towards the player through the map
